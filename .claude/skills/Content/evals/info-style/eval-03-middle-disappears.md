# Eval 03: The Middle Disappears

## Source
`content/posts/0104-orchestration-26.md`

## Concept
The middle layer of software development is vanishing. Previously: Specs → Manual Implementation → Code. Now: Specs → Agents → Code. The translation layer (requirements → code) compresses to near-zero. What remains: problem understanding at input, agent management at output.

## Input Prompt
"Info style diagram showing the middle layer compression: before (specs → implementation → code with thick middle) vs after (specs → agents → code with thin/compressed middle)"

## Visual Expectation
A process flow showing compression:
- TOP/BEFORE: Three stages with substantial middle section
- BOTTOM/AFTER: Same three stages but middle is visibly compressed/thin
- Arrows or flow lines connecting stages
- Middle section could show particles/dissolution (being compressed)
- Clear directionality (left to right, or top to bottom)

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] Clear process/flow structure
- [ ] Visible compression of middle layer
- [ ] Before/after or transformation visible
- [ ] Three stages identifiable
- [ ] Not cluttered with details
- [ ] Flow direction obvious
- [ ] Middle layer "thinning" is the focal point
- [ ] Handdrawn warmth, not digital precision

## Common Failures
- Just showing three boxes with arrows
- No visual representation of "compression"
- Text-heavy (labeling each stage)
- Before/after not clearly differentiated
- Too literal (showing actual code)
- Missing the transformation aspect

## Reference
> "Coding agents now turn specs into working code without manual implementation. The middle layer—translating requirements into code—compresses to zero. What remains: problem understanding at the input and agent management at the output."
