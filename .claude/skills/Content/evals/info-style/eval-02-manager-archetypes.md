# Eval 02: Three Manager Archetypes

## Source
`content/essays/0105-management-agent-era-26.md`

## Concept
Three distinct manager forms emerge in the agent era:
1. **M-shaped Supervisors**: Broad generalists who orchestrate across domains. Value = integration.
2. **T-shaped Experts**: Deep domain specialists who handle escalated exceptions (the 5% agents can't handle).
3. **AI-Augmented Frontline**: Workers with agent augmentation handling work that previously required entire teams.

## Input Prompt
"Info style diagram showing three manager archetypes: M-shaped (broad orchestrator), T-shaped (deep expert), AI-augmented frontline (worker with agents)"

## Visual Expectation
Three distinct icons/shapes arranged horizontally or in a triangle:
- M-shape: Wide figure spanning multiple domains (broad, horizontal emphasis)
- T-shape: Figure with deep vertical stem (depth emphasis)
- Frontline: Human figure with satellite circles (person + agent network)
- Each clearly differentiated by shape language
- Possible: subtle hierarchy showing M-shaped at top as orchestrator

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] Three distinct, differentiated shapes
- [ ] M-shape reads as "broad" (horizontal emphasis)
- [ ] T-shape reads as "deep" (vertical emphasis)
- [ ] Frontline shows human-agent relationship
- [ ] Not just letters M, T - actual visual metaphors
- [ ] Clean separation between archetypes
- [ ] Consistent handdrawn style
- [ ] Maximum 5-6 elements total

## Common Failures
- Drawing literal letters "M" and "T"
- Three identical human figures with labels
- Too abstract (shapes with no meaning)
- Too complex (trying to show everything each archetype does)
- Inconsistent visual language between the three

## Reference
> "M-shaped Supervisors are broad generalists who orchestrate across domains... T-shaped Experts have deep domain expertise and handle escalated exceptions... AI-Augmented Frontline workers use agents for routine work and focus on high-value human activities."
