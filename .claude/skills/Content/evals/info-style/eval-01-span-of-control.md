# Eval 01: Span of Control Shift

## Source
`content/essays/0105-management-agent-era-26.md`

## Concept
Traditional management handled 1:12 direct reports (human coordination limit). The agent era enables 1:50 to 1:100 agents per manager. This isn't about cheaper workers—it's a fundamental change in coordination when reports operate at machine speed.

## Input Prompt
"Info style diagram showing the span of control shift: traditional management 1:12 humans vs agent era 1:50-100 agents"

## Visual Expectation
A before/after comparison:
- LEFT: One figure connected to 12 smaller figures (human team)
- RIGHT: One figure connected to many more elements (50-100 dots/circles representing agents)
- Clear visual contrast in density/scale
- Single focal point (the manager figure or the contrast point)

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] Clear before/after structure (not merged into one mess)
- [ ] Numbers visually represented (not just written)
- [ ] Manager figure distinguishable from team
- [ ] Scale difference is dramatic and obvious
- [ ] No text/labels (or minimal)
- [ ] Handdrawn aesthetic maintained
- [ ] Dark background, amber/gold linework

## Common Failures
- Text-heavy (writing "1:12" instead of showing it)
- Numbers too literal (drawing exactly 12 vs 100 identical figures)
- No visual hierarchy (manager same size as reports)
- Cluttered (too many elements competing)
- Digital/clean look instead of handdrawn

## Reference
> "Traditional management handled 1:12 direct reports. The emerging pattern is 1:50 to 1:100 agents. Not because agents are cheaper humans, but because the coordination function fundamentally changes when your reports operate at machine speed and never sleep."
