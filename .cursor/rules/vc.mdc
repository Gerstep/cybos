1. Review all data in data/vc/{company_name}
2. If you find a pitch deck, convert to md
3. Read all the files
4. Write a summary analysis in the new file in the same directory

# PDF

- If you encounter PDF file for any task, run scripts/parse_pdf.py first to convert it to the .md format
- Usage: python scripts/parse_pdf.py /path/to/file.pdf

- Record the result of the search in the data/temp directory and access it later to complete the initial task

# Reference checks
